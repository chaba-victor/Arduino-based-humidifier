# Introduction:
There are three key components to healthy air. It must be fresh, clean, and
have the proper humidity. Humans are sensitive to humidity because the
human body uses evaporative cooling, enabled by perspiration, as the
primary mechanism to rid itself of waste heat. Humans can be comfortable
within a wide range of humidity depending on the temperatureâ€”from thirty
to seventy percent but ideally between 50% and 60%. Very low humidity can
create discomfort, respiratory problems, and aggravate allergies in some
individuals. In the winter, it is advisable to maintain relative humidity at 30
percent or above. Extremely low (below 20%) relative humidity may also
cause eye irritation. Humidify your home, especially the bedrooms.Low
humidity is a common cause of nosebleeds. The right humidity levels help
your home to feel cool in the summer and warm in the winter.In the winter,
or in regions that tend to be cold for most of the year, humidification, or
adding moisture, is essential.
This project senses temperature & humidity from your room or environment
and check either it is in comfortable range or not. If it finds that relative
humidity is lower than the required limit, it turns on the humidifier for 10
seconds, then again checks the humidity level. If not adequate then again
turns on. Seeed studio HSM20G
temperature & humidity sensor is used here
to sense the temperature and humidity. A LCD display is used to show the
temperature and humidity level on your room. You can use Grove button to
manually control the humidifier. To control all the things Arduino UNO is
used.
